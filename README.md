### Overview

**Nexus AI Editor** is a privacy-first, offline-capable video editing framework powered by local artificial intelligence models. It processes all video data directly on your hardware — never requiring cloud services, external APIs, or data transmission.

> Engineered for creators who value sovereignty over convenience.  
> Built for developers who believe intelligence should be transparent.  
> Designed for humanity that deserves digital dignity.

This is not a replacement for commercial editors.  
It is a **paradigm shift** in how creative tools should respect users.

### Core Philosophy

#### 🔒 Zero-Data Architecture  
All AI models (background removal, transcription, stabilization) run entirely on your device. No telemetry. No analytics. No hidden endpoints.

#### ⚡ Adaptive Performance  
Dynamically scales from Raspberry Pi 4 to workstation GPUs — using quantized models and hardware acceleration where available.

#### 🧩 Modular Intelligence  
Swap AI components without rebuilding:  
- `Nexus-Vision` — Scene analysis & object detection (YOLO-Nano)  
- `Nexus-Whisper` — Offline speech-to-text (Whisper.cpp)  
- `Nexus-Stabilize` — Motion compensation (OpenCV + Kalman filters)  
- `Nexus-Color` — Cinematic grading (custom LUT engine)  

#### 🌐 Federated Learning Ready  
Contribute anonymized model improvements back to the community — without sharing raw footage.

### Technical Capabilities

#### ▸ Intelligent Clip Processing
- Automatic highlight detection via audio spikes and motion vectors  
- Smart b-roll insertion based on semantic scene analysis  
- Background removal with hair-detail preservation (RTMPose integration)  

#### ▸ Privacy-Preserving Workflow
- On-device face blurring with configurable sensitivity  
- Metadata scrubbing (GPS, timestamps, device IDs) before export  
- Encrypted project files with zero-knowledge keys  

#### ▸ Professional Output
- 4K timeline rendering with hardware acceleration  
- Broadcast-safe color spaces (REC.709, DCI-P3)  
- Platform-optimized exports (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram presets)  

#### ▸ Developer Experience
- Python API for custom AI pipeline integration  
- WASM builds for web-based demos (no server required)  
- Docker containers for reproducible research environments

### Getting Started

#### For Creators
1. Download the latest release for your OS  
2. Extract and run `nexus-editor`  
3. Create project → Import media → Activate AI tools  

### Why Nexus Stands Apart

| Feature           | Traditional Cloud Editors          | Nexus AI Editor                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Data Flow**     | Upload → Process → Download        | Process locally → Export            |
| **AI Models**     | Proprietary black boxes            | Open weights, audit trails          |
| **Cost**          | Subscription + bandwidth fees      | One-time hardware investment        |
| **Ownership**     | Platform-controlled outputs        | Your media, your rights             |
| **Offline Use**   | Limited or none                    | Full functionality                  |

> This isn't just editing software.  
> It's a **manifesto for digital sovereignty**.

### Privacy Commitment

<div id="privacy">

We collect **no data**. Not your videos. Not your projects. Not your usage patterns.  
The only telemetry is **optional, anonymized hardware metrics** to optimize model performance — and you control it.

All AI models are:  
✅ Open weights (MIT licensed)  
✅ Verifiable training data  
✅ Auditable inference pipelines  

Your creativity remains yours — forever.

### Community & Contribution

**We welcome:**  
- Model optimization for low-end hardware  
- New localization languages  
- Accessibility features (audio descriptions, sign language avatars)  
- Privacy-preserving collaboration tools  

**Not accepted:**  
- Cloud-dependent features  
- DRM or license enforcement code  
- Any component requiring user data transmission  

---

### License

Distributed under dual licensing:  
- **MIT License** — for personal/educational use  
- **Apache 2.0** — for commercial integration  

> All AI models carry their respective research licenses (clearly documented in `/models/LICENSES`).

### Final Note

If you believe creativity shouldn't require surrendering privacy —  
if you think intelligence belongs to the user, not the platform —  
if you demand tools that respect your humanity...

**This is your editor.**

> Built in silence. Released for the sovereign creator.
